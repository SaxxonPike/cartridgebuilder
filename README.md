# CartridgeBuilder: Commodore 64 CRT File Builder

### What is it?
CartridgeBuilder is designed to take a configuration file and output a
CRT image file. There are a lot of configuration options which are best
demonstrated by the included examples.

The Legacy of the Ancients + Legend of Blacksilver combo cartridge was
created using CartridgeBuilder, and you can see the final product
here: http://csdb.dk/release/?id=128480

CartridgeBuilder is a command-line application built in C#.

More documentation to come later.
